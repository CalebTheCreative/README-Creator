# README-Creator

## Description

An application that utilizes inquirer to ask users to input information in their command-line and then creates a README.md file using that information.

## Installation

In order to use the application, the user will need to install node.js. Once they have the folder opened in their command line, they will need to run 'npm install' and 'npm install inquirer' if inquirer isnt already in their node mudule folder.

## Usage

The application is meant to be run in the command-line. After the user has installed node.js and 'inquirer' in the Develop folder, they will need to enter 'node index' in the command-line. The user will then need to answer the questions that are prompted. Once the user has answered the questions, they will receive a message notifying them that the README.md file has been successfully written within the Develop folder.
